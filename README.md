## Description
This project is ran with node.js.   Using inquire ,  two different types of prompts are fired with different paths depending on userinput. Using a generic employee constructor and 3 subclasses the users input is ultimately translated into an HTML friendly series of template literals that iterate through an array of employees the user has created to dynamically generate cards for each employee. By default the first employee is always the manager and so the first prompt relates to them. Every other prompt is for additional employees, wether they be interns or engineers.
